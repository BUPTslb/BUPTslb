I am a casual football enthusiast and a member of the Computer Science School Football Team at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. We won the [third place in the 2022 KeYuan Cup](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwOTU0MjUyMQ==&mid=2650499392&idx=2&sn=7f4c5e69d89c94bd7265097b1285d059&chksm=8351c756b4264e407f23900812dd666b77d7dd4fea773a10d2b210dbd2e185ff506b6a4c5370&scene=27).

I enjoy recitation and participated in the May Flower Literary and Art Gala in 2022. Unfortunately, it was a dubbing performance, and I struggled with facial expressions management. Fortunately, our team won the first prize. Video is [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av811404763/?vd_source=1920e32e7644aafe109ad2f9ec08c4a9).

I used to be a production assistant in two movies of CCTV6 [Êã≥Â§©‰∏ã‰πãÊã≥Èîã](https://movie.douban.com/subject/35314511/),[Êã≥Â§©‰∏ã‰πãÊã≥Âäõ](https://movie.douban.com/subject/35314509/). If you're careful enough, you will find me in the movie as some walk-onsüòÑ.(Attention please: both are super terrible movies!)
